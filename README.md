# Sorting Algorithm Visualisation
This repository contains C# based implementations of different sorting algorithms. Each algorithm has been visualised using WPF with the ability to change array size and sorting speed. The content resizes dynamically depending on window size.\
When running slow sorting speed I recommend using an array size of 50-200 (depends on the algorithm).


☝ *Please note that this project mainly serves educational purposes. As I´m relatively new to C# and WPF the code will have some flaws. Certain features are WIP still.*

## Algorithms currently included:

* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort

*More sorting algorithms will be added later!*\
