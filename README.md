# Sorting Algorithm Visualisation
This repository contains C# based implementations of different sorting algorithms. Each algorithm has been visualised using WPF with the ability to change array size and sorting speed.

☝ *Please note that this project mainly serves educational purposes. As I´m still relatively new to C# and WPF the code will have some flaws. Certain features are WIP still.*

## Example

## The Current implementation includes:

* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Quick Sort

More sorting algorithms will be added later!
